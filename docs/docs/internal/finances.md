# Finances

This page tracks the currently server expenses and balance. The finances of this server are made public.

The goal of this server is not to make a profit. Any profit is either reinvested into the server, or donated to software the server uses to run, e.g. [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

| Date  | Item     | Amount |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| 11/19 | OVH      | $68.36 |
| 11/22 | Logo     | $40.00 |
| 11/22 | BorgBase | $24.00 |

Note: This will be replaced with something more robust in the future.
