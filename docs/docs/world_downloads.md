# World Downloads

The server periodically publishes copies of the world for players to download. The purpose of providing these copies is to ensure that the server does not have a monopoly of the creation of its players.

These copies are available three months after they are taken. The purpose for this delay is to avoid giving away the location of private areas that a player may be in.

A snapshot of the world is taken at the end of each quarter of the year. These map snapshots become available for anyone to download three months after they are taken. To illustrate, a snapshot is taken in March, June, August, and December. The snapshot taken in March will be available in June, the snapshot taken in June will be available in August, and so on.
